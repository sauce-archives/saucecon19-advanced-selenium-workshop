# Exercise 7: Refactor Test Code as Declaritive
1. Checkout branch ``07_declaritive_tests``
2. At this point our code is imperitive, to optimize test operations at scale, as well as simplifying troubleshooting, we will refactor our existing test methods as declartive. In **LogInTest**, refactor the following methods to be declartive:
    * signInSuccessfully()
    * signInUnsuccessfully()
    * signInBlankPassword()  
3. To best utilize declartive tests, we need to implement the page object model. Proceed to the next exercise to create a **`SignInPage`** and a **`HomePage`**.
