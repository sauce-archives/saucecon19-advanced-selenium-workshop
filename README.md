# Java Selenium Examples

This directory contains example scripts and dependencies for running automated Selenium tests on Sauce Labs using Java. You can use these scripts to test your Sauce Labs authentication credentials, the setup of your automated testing environment, and try out Sauce Labs features, like cross-browser testing. Feel free to copy these files or clone the entire directory to your local environment to experiment with creating your own automated Selenium tests!

#### For Demonstration Purposes Only

The code in these scripts is provided on an "AS-IS‚Äù basis without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including without limitation any implied warranties of condition, uninterrupted use, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. These scripts are provided for educational and demonstration purposes only, and should not be used in production. Issues regarding these scripts should be submitted through GitHub. These scripts are maintained by the Technical Services team at Sauce Labs.

<br />

## Description

These procedures will show you to set up a Selenium environment for Java. The scripts in this repository allow you run a simple automated test to validate your Selenium environment and your [saucelabs.com](https://app.saucelabs.com/login) account credentials.

## Exercises

To begin the exercises refer [to this page](selenium-exercsies/EXERCISE_README.md).

## Prerequisites

In order to complete these exercises you must complete the following prerequisite installation and configuration steps:

* Install Git
* Install IntelliJ
* Install JDK
* Setup Project

### Install Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) is a version control system that lets you check out code from a repository, 
work with that code on your own branch, and then merge that code with any changes that have been made by other developers. 
Git is an essential tool for distributed development teams, and is a critical component of the continuous 
integration/continuous development toolchain.

#### MacOSX:

1. Go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Under **Downloads**, click **Mac OS X**.
3. When the download completes, double-click the `.dmg` file open the installer package.
4. Double-click the installer package to begin the installation.
    > *Security Warning*
    >
    > You may see a warning message that the package can't be opened because it's not from a recognized developer. 
    If this happens, go to System Preferences > Security and Privacy Settings, and click Open Anyway.
5. Click **Continue** for the installation, and enter your local password to authorize the installation.

#### Windows:

1. Go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Setup the Project

#### Ensure IntelliJ is Correctly Configured:

1. **Run Hello World**
    * In IntelliJ, select **File > New > Project.**
    * In the **New Project** dialog window, select **Java** (default).
    * IntelliJ should automatically detect the JDK and appear in the **Project SDK** field. If you don't see the JDK, select **New** and navigate to where you installed the JDK. 
    * Select **Next**, then select **Create project from template > Java Hello World.**
    * Name the project **SauceDemo** and select **Finish.** 
        > you can also decide whether or not to display IntelliJ tool tips.
    * From the main toolbar, select **Run > Run 'Main'**.
        > In the main console at the bottom the words ` Hello World!` should appear, along with ` Process finished with exit code 0`. 

2. **Configure the Selenium Standalone Server**
    * Open a browser and navigate to the [SeleniumHQ Downloads page](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/).
    * Under **Selenium Standalone Server** select the version link to download the file (extract/unzip the archive if necessary).

    * Copy and paste both your **`Username`** and **`Access Key`** to your clipboard
    * In IntelliJ, replace the below strings with your **`Username`** and **`Access Key`**
        ```
        String sauceUserName = "YOUR USER NAME";
        String sauceAccessKey = "YOUR ACCESS KEY";
        ```
6. **Running the Test on Sauce Labs**
    * In IntelliJ, select the **`InstantJavaTestNGTest`** class, right-click anywhere, select **`Run shouldOpenSafari()`**, and check the console at the bottom of the window.
    * You should see the following in the IntelliJ console:
    ```
