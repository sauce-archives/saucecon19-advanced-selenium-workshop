### Install Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) is a version control system that lets you check out code from a repository, 
work with that code on your own branch, and then merge that code with any changes that have been made by other developers. 
Git is an essential tool for distributed development teams, and is a critical component of the continuous 
integration/continuous development toolchain.

    * Download and extract the latest `tutorial_mac.zip` file, or the one that matches the name of your workshop.
        > You can save the zip file to any directory you want, including Downloads. You will just need to remember the 
        directory when you want to open the tutorial files in IntelliJ. 

2. Opening the Project in IntelliJ

    * Click **Open**.
    * Browse to the **junit_tests** directory, and click **Open**.
    * Click the **Sidebars** icon in the lower left corner of IntelliJ to open the sidebars.
    * Open the **Project** sidebar and expand the directories **lib > src > test**.
    * In the **test/examples** directory, double click **LocalExecution**, and a sample file will load into the editor window.

3. Configure the Project SDK

     > When the file loads, you'll see a notification at the top of the file that the SDK for the project is not defined.
    * Click **Setup SDK**, and then **Configure**.
    * Click **+** in the **Configure SDK** dialog.
    * Select **Java SDK**.

        closes a browser, confirming that the Selenium environment is running on your local machine.

5. Ensure Git is properly configured
    * Click the terminal tab on the bottom left of IntelliJ
    * Type the following commands into the terminal, replacing the example information with your own
        ```
